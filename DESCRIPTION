Description: The package eseis contains a growing set of function 
    to handle the complete workflow of environmental seismology, 
    i.e., the scientific field that studies the seismic signals 
    that are emitted by Earth surface processes. The package supports
    reading the two most common seismic data formats, general 
    functions for preparational and analytical signal processing as 
    well as specified functions for handling signals generated by 
    Earth surface processes. Finally, graphical plot functions are
    provided, too.
